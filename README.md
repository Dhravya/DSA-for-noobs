# Data Structures and Algorithms:

This is a collection of data structures and algorithms that I write while learning the subject

## Stack:
stack.py
A stack algorithm is a data structure that is like a pack of cards - a stack.
Stack has the following properties:

### Push
Adds element to the top of the stack

### Pop
Removes element from the top of the stack

### Peek
Returns the element at the top of the stack

Size and is_empty are just helper functions
